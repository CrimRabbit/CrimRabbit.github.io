                    <p>Some hear it in their dreams, after a long night of drinking and inebriated dancing. Others hear it after a warm celebration with family. But everyone agrees that on the day we turn 18, the first words we hear on that day would be the ones that would be our last. Of course, some people chose to disregard those words as myth and baseless speculation. Me? It’s up for debate. The theatre is an interesting place you see. And nowhere else better than upon the stage, spotlights glaring on you with the world’s gazes unable to peel their eyes off as you mesmerise the floor with your song. Tonight’s play was held much later than normal, a rich young sheikh single-handedly paying for practically three quarters of all the seats and demanding that we started two hours late. With eyes wide at the amount of money paid, of course the stage manager said yes. And thus you have me, poor Lorene singing on the stage as the clock struck 12 to her 18th birthday.</p>
<p>“Oh, please don’t let me die, waiting for your touch.”</p>
<p>In hindsight, it was a pretty interesting event. The whole theatre fully booked, yet that rich sheikh said he merely brought his family and their retainers. Which filled up the hundreds of seats he bought out.</p>
<p>“No, don’t give up on life, this endless dead end.”</p>
<p>This song, it was supposed to be a lamentation. Of one who was willing to die for another, yet desired to live so dearly. And the other who saw his devotion in her hour of sorrows, life torn between duty and love. I don’t recall the ending to the story though, every time the stage manager reached the halfway point of the story there would always be a distraction that demanded us back to our duties. Such was this life of mine. Regardless, I did my best to imagine the rest of the story. An eerie city, where half the populace would hide themselves from the prying eyes of others. The buildings would grow tall and enormous, strangely looming over you whilst blotting out the sun, yet filled with paints and oraments of gold and white. Within which, a lost person would wander listless and alone.
Glancing back at my audience, it was interesting to see how many of them were young women. The shekih appeared mesmerized, the other ladies, not so much. Still, I gave him a smile. He was paying for the show after all!</p>
<p>After the show, the stage manager passed me a letter with worried eyes. Apparently that rich sheikh wanted to hire me as a performer in his home country, some far distant land. My daily necesseties and life would be basically paid for and all I’d need to do is sing. Seemingly, an easy life without worry for money.</p>
<p>…I mean, it IS an easy life right?</p>
<p>[The two lines of song are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkjaDJNx5xY">MYTH &amp; ROID’s Styx Helix</a>.]</p>
