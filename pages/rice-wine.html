                <p>“Sarah.”
The voice snapped Sarah out of her reverie, where she’d been lost in thoughts all alone.</p>
<p>“I had wondered where you gone off to.”
“Cecilia?” Sarah looked up in surprise to see a friend, another woman whose life once lain in shambles, sitting down beside her. “I’m sorry, please leave me alone for now.”</p>
<p>“Mmm.” Cecilia nodded, but made no attempt to move. Instead she reached into the small bag she brought, producing a small bottle and two tiny cups. “It’s only expected. I would talk to you regardless, if you’ll hear me.”</p>
<p>Sarah sighed, she truly was in no mood for company. Not after what happened earlier in the day. Not right now. Still, Cecilia was a friend; she’d been raised better to just turn away someone who wanted to talk. She saw no reason to deny Cecilia’s request after all, save for her own poor mood. “Of course.” She shifted in place, turning to slightly face her counterpart.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Cecilia said nothing more, simply pulling the cork from the bottle and tipping a small amount into the two cups. Sarah watched disinterestedly, hugging her knees. “Here.” She offered seconds later, passing one to Sarah.</p>
<p>Sarah sighed. She was not a big drinker, the occasional sampling she got whilst attending formal parties and mixers all the experience she had with alocohol. In fact, with the males in her family dead she had even less reason to during those parties. The need to always be mindful of her appearance, clear-headed in case anything happened had been too pressing. Yet to simply turn away an offered gift from someone concerned, she was raised better than that. Hesitantly she brought the cup to her lips, taking a small sip.</p>
<p>“Ugh. Bitter!” She moaned a moment later. The wines she had drunk tasted nothing like that!</p>
<p>“Hmmph.” Cecilia chuckled at her sour face. “It’s bitter indeed! It’s a rice wine from my mother’s homeland; I fear the taste must be an acquired one!” Sipping from her own saucer, Cecilia smiled, enjoying the bitter tang.</p>
<p>“But then, isn’t it appropriate? A bitter taste for a bitter mood?”</p>
<p>Sarah frowned. The day had been long enough without people guessing at her emotions. “My mood is none of your business.” She had no mood to talk about what was bothering her, much less someone who deigned to butt into what little of privacy her hectic schedule afforded. They had hardly known each other on a personal level!</p>
<p>“Yes.” Cecilia replied gently. “I can imagine how you must feel.”</p>
<p>Sarah didn’t bother responding to that, sipping again from her cup. No doubt Cecilia had good intentions, but to claim that she could imagine the raging emotions in Sarah’s chest was offensive.</p>
<p>“Actually, we are quite similar, both you and I.” Cecilia continued, seemingly at her own pace.</p>
<p>Sarah glared at the woman, but noticed that she was not even looking at her, simply staring off into the distance as if lost in her own thoughts. “How so?” Sarah was a girl in a family whose lineage had been cut short, all the males dead from a freak accident. With the burden of keeping her family’s ancestral forge roaring, yet with arms too slender to wield a hammer, she had spent her teenage years attempting to master the craft before her father expired from the wounds he suffered. Charged with an unwanted duty, she found herself without the strength to continue on, nor the courage to drop it all and leave. Worse still, she had slapped the only person who attempted to share her burdens, railing at him in a fit of rage born of loneliness.</p>
<p>“Both our lives once lay in ruins.” Cecilia offered simply, reaching over to refill their empty cups.</p>
<p>Sarah sighed, rolling her eyes. Many could make a similar claim.</p>
<p>“We are both given a lineage to uphold, a line of succession held by our own hand.” Cecilia probed again, hitting closer to home. “Our skills are well-honed, but we own none of the supposed wealth they bring.”</p>
<p>“The same could be said for many a legacy.” Sarah countered. That was obviously a blanket statement.</p>
<p>“Yes. But they are not all of young women who desire praise from the family they had lost.”</p>
<p>That definitely hit too close to home. Gritting her teeth, Sarah bit her tongue from lashing back with pained comments, choosing to drain her cup of the bitter drink once more.</p>
<p>“Tch. You need not hide it Sarah. It’s the same for me. Would it that I could have my family back, that I could have Mic-my brother back. I am proud to succeed my family’s legacy, but..”</p>
<p>Her words trailed off. Sarah felt her indignation fading, the bitter pain in Cecilia’s voice not far from her own.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the drink, or some strange gesture of solidarity, but Sarah found her response unbidden. “I lost most of my family when I was twelve. I was too young; mother tried to take over the house… then father came back dying. I wanted so hard for him to live I’d thought that maybe if I made him smile.. if I had achieved what brother could no longer achieve, that he would stay longer. B-but mother soon died from exhaustion as well, caring for a girl who flung herself at the forge and a husband who could do nothing but watch his daughter desperately pound on the anvil.”</p>
<p>Wincing in pain, Cecilia nodded. “Yes. To face reality as it is, harsh and unyielding. I struggled as hard as I could to scrounge up money, tried to save my brother who stole to keep bread on the table. He went to become a triad member anyway, leaving me in that dinghy hut. All I did, and then the triad… it all meant nothing.”</p>
<p>“I now have a family, even if they are not the most able in their lives.” Sarah admitted, knowing the same untrue for Cecilia. “But I love them nonetheless.”</p>
<p>“True.” Cecilia nodded. “But you have suffered greatly and sacrificed much. I see the calluses on your rough hands, the tearlines on your face, just as anyone else would. Would that you could… Just make things right, that somehow you had the power to turn back time to make the right choice. To bring back the family that you lost.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” She didnt know of Cecilia was talking to her, or herself, but in the end it didn’t matter. It was true regardless.</p>
<p>The two women lapsed into silence for a long moment, cups passed back and forth slowly. It was not strong enough to make Sarah lightheaded, but slowly, strange as the company she held now, the bitterness of the drink faded.</p>
<p>“I saw you yesterday, whilst on patrol.” Cecilia admitted finally, “I saw the hurt on your face when you saw your husband selling the blade your family handed down to you.”</p>
<p>“Cecilia!” Sarah almost shouted. She had no wish to talk about this. “I don-”</p>
<p>“I also saw you follow him enter the triad’s trading house.”</p>
<p>The woman’s words hung thick in the air and Sarah found herself unable to speak. She knew what she had done, what she had asked.</p>
<p>With a grieved face, Cecilia sniffed. “I…tch.”</p>
<p>Turning in shock, Sarah was surprised to see the terrible visage on the stoic policewoman’s face. “I was so glad when you walked out.. when I saw your husband walking behind you.”</p>
<p>“I-” Sarah winced. It wasn’t that simple! She had meant to disown him, even kill him if he insisted on selling the blade! She had raised her own sword against her husband! She had asked for his death.. and failed him as a wife by asking for it, and she had failed her lineage by not being able to stop him from selling it.</p>
<p>“F-for, that’s our most terrible similarity.” Cecilia sighed, looking towards the ground, unable to meet Sarah’s eyes. “We are both unforgivable women who raised our weapons against the person we love most. Who asked for their death, for our cause.”</p>
<p>“C-cecilia..” She gasped, she had hardly thought of Cecilia in such a light. No one had, not even the department against the triad all those years ago, knew for a fact that it had all been a trick, a terrible blackmail by the head of the triad. No one blamed Cecilia for taking her brother’s life!</p>
<p>None but Cecilia herself.</p>
<p>Mutely Sarah remembered, her husband had forgiven her for asking for his life in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>“Both of us faced down a loved one, both of us asked for their life…” Cecilia continued bitterly, “But, only one of us dropped her weapon.”</p>
<p>“It..it wasn’t like that.” Sarah countered feebly.</p>
<p>“Would it that I had your courage Sarah, the faith to believe in him…would it that I put down my gun.” Cecilia tembled in remorse, draining the cup she held.</p>
<p>“I-”</p>
<p>“I do understand you.” Cecilia added powerlessly. “You worry about your past, about not living up to the ideals of your lineage. Sarah, I lived that ideal. I killed my brother for myself and for the country.”</p>
<p>“Sarah..” Cecilia sniffed once more, red rimmed eyes filled with agony. Sarah found herself averting her gaze. It was hard to look at the once stoic policewoman’s eyes. “I’m glad beyond words that you did not follow the same path as I did. Do not even think yourself on it; it’s a path with no happiness to be found.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry.” Sarah offered, yet knowing her words meant nothing. “You’re right, perhaps we are more similar than I had thought.”</p>
<p>Wincing again, Cecilia smiled weakly. “In truth I came to speak to you because I have seen your husband’s pain. He cries by the riverbank not wanting to return home and yet I…understand.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, Sarah thought again, that Cecilia could understand better than anyone else.</p>
<p>“Go to him Sarah. He blames you not for what happened, nor does he love you any less. Instead he cries for his own weakness in being incapable to support you.”</p>
<p>“I-”</p>
<p>“Go, and wonder not if you should have walked my path. Go and be happy.”</p>
<p>Even with the policewoman’s words echoing in her ears, it took Saraha full moment to gather the strength to rise. Closing her eyes as she rose on unsteady legs, gathering the resolve to leave the past behind and worry about her future.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Cecilia smiled, watching her run toward the riverbank.</p>
<p>Left with none but her ghosts she reached over to pick up the bottle of rice wine, giving her cup a passing glance before raising the bottle to her lips.</p>
<p>“The courage to have dropped my gun… To have believed in him…”</p>
<p>It truly was a bitter drink.</p>
