                    <p>“Alright then, just like we went through! Armor knights! Wave formation!” Morgan yelled, while the knights and infantry rushed forward to create a series of chevrons, forming a ‘w’ shape. It put the brunt of any enemy charge upon the tips of the chevrons, where the heaviest infantry stood, with progressively lighter infantry further down the edge. That gave the mages at the bottom a perfect cone for blast their enemies with, while the mages in the center of the point had unparalleled access to targets.</p>
<p>“Telrize, any thoughts?” she called behind her. In a real battle, she’d be standing with the mages anyway, but the few Morgan could wrangle into practice on a holiday tended to be those closer to her. This unfortunately did not encompass many armored knights.</p>
<p>“Oh man, this is amazing,” Telrize replied. “I can hit anywhere, but I’m completely protected by a tiny girl in a tin can!” Grin forming on his lips, Telrize made a show of casting spells and flinging them ahead of the formation, much to Morgan’s chagrin. The other soldiers started to chuckle.</p>
<p>“Not completely. You’re at greater risk of bombardment by archers since you’ll be closer to the front, and we’ll need a mage or two on the defense to intercept incoming arrows and magic. I think you’ll do just fine on defense, let the other mages cast their offensive spells.” Morgan huffed. Watching his face, she hid her smile under her helmet as Telrize appeared somewhat disheartened. “Or you could try focusing large spells in the middle of any large enemy formation instead. I hear someone’s coming up with a new ‘Lord of the Vermillion’ revision.”</p>
<p>“Ask and ye shall receive.” Telrize complied proudly, casting an incomplete version of the spell that simply scorched the ground lightly. Its effect, however, was not lost on Morgan as she imagined the spell actually blasting enemies in combat. The incomplete version was little more than a lightshow, she’d admit, but the revision had increased the spell’s range and throughput significantly.</p>
<p>With that, Morgan started liking this formation a little more, but it wasn’t perfect. She wondered if a slight variation would improve it more, but when she turned her gaze upon the other soldiers the idea wandered just out of mental reach.</p>
<p>“That’ll do for today,” she said as the thought slipped away completely. A group of sighs suggested that perhaps calling for a short training session on a holiday might not have been the best idea. She certainly exhausted herself thinking of formations and strategies to try, but she assumed it was the remnants of the last few months of her new assignment. In the rush of soldiers departing for what was a free day, she spotted Yuliya approach, pushing her way through the crowd. Scanning around more, she found Telrize jokingly grabbing another friend by the shoulder and leading them to the barracks. Catching Morgan’s gaze on him, he smiled and nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>“-ich you need to stop! MORGAN!” Yuliya grabbed her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Huh? Yuliya? What’s up?” Morgan replied, distracted.</p>
<p>“I’m saying that you’ve spent the whole of four sessions creating strategies for your mages! Not to complain here, but maybe you’ve been focusing too much in that regard?”</p>
<p>“Err, in any tight enemy formation mages with attacks that hit a wide area tend to excel. With all the practice we’ve done in the past for flanking and reconnaissance I figured we needed something for staying power, y’know?” Trying to squirm out of her grasp, Morgan tried taking a step back, but found herself trapped within the armor. For her lithe frame Yuliya had strength that seemed to appear out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“Oh no you don’t. We are having lunch at your home, following that we will be playing Pronteran Melee,” Yuliya spat, annoyed. “You’ll find yourself in a little trouble today.”</p>
<p>“Ohh? So our sniper specialist decides she’s good enough for grand strategy eh?” Morgan sneered, with a glint of competitiveness in her eye.</p>
<hr>
<p>“I’m back!” Michealis yelled as he strode into the house, sack of ores bumping the door as he walked. Yuliya looked up and threw him a lazy wave, causally ignoring her opponent glaring at the third consecutive round on the back foot. Michealis glanced over, looking at their game and his sister with curiosity. Morgan continued to glare at the board. After a moment, he shrugged and turned to walk into his forge. Yuliya, who had been silently playing against Morgan thus far, leaned forward and appraised the board again. Certainly, Morgan had taken the correct choke points for halting Yuliya’s advance. She had even deviously exposed her archers, which Yuliya was certain were a trap. If not for Morgan’s obvious attempts to force the game into a traditional infantry clash where her mages would shine, Yuliya wasn’t sure if she could predict her opponent’s next moves.</p>
<p>“You do know that I’m but the team’s sniper specialist right?” Yuliya started after Michealis shut the door to his forge.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And that you’re the team’s tactician under the tutelage of the country’s Royal Tactician?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>“Then why is it that I’m handily beating you at your own game?” Yuliya finished, leaning back in her seat. Taking her cup of iced tea by the counter, she sipped at her drink while eyeing Morgan curiously. Watching Morgan stew in frustration, she sighed. “You’re overly enamored with that mage, Morgan. It’s seeping into the way you think and act.” Gesturing to the board, Yuliya regarded the two chokepoints Morgan held coolly. “Even now in this board game you are favoring your mages too much, using infantry as walls attempting to stop my advance. Something which archers like myself love picking off.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t that simple as that, is it?” Morgan began, hopeful. “Now I have the valley under control, even if your archers are in range to pick my soldiers off. They still can’t secure your victory. Please don’t tell me you’ve a bunch of knights running around the side of the valley now?”</p>
<p>Yuliya sighed again; revealing her mounted knights units just shy of Morgan’s viewing distance. Dismayed, Morgan sank back into her seat. The third round in a row! She had played right into her opponent’s hands! Angrily grabbing her drink off the counter, Morgan drained the cup in one gulp. The ice in the drink provided a refreshing taste, one which Morgan grudgingly appreciated through her frustration. Slapping her cheeks, she analyzed the board again. Perhaps there was a way out of this predicament?</p>
<p>“Morgan, talk to me. I know you’re hoping that you would catch Telrize’s eye favoring mages so much. Learning ‘Thunderbolt’, adapting your tactics. I don’t think the man’s so blind to not notice. Why not ask him out already?”</p>
<p>“You don’t know what it’s like! It’s easy to see what I should do yet following it is impossible!” Morgan whined, exasperated. Telrize was the prodigal child of the city’s mages academy! Even as an apprentice, he had the skills to talk causally with veteran wizards. To even think of asking the mage out was beyond her!</p>
<p>“No it isn’t that hard at all. Telrize is as easygoing as they come,” Yuliya groaned. “You just need to pick yourself up and speak to him.”</p>
<p>“And what will he do? He has his recent spell revision theory to boggle about! Why would he even speak to a tactician-in-training when all we have to communicate is to command each other on the training grounds?”</p>
<p>“You do realize, Morgan, that regardless of positions the both of you are in the same team?”</p>
<p>“That makes it worse! I know I have to speak to him, but having to do so just..” Morgan trailed off, unsure of how to continue.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of him, Morgan?” Yuliya started, patience seemingly starting to wear thin.</p>
<p>“Wha- No!” Morgan exclaimed. ‘Afraid’ was not, should not, be the term she would use, was it? “..Actually, some bit yes. When I think of telling him what to do I’d think of other better things he could do that I may not have thought of.” Admitting her own faults was not that difficult, it was admitting them to those she needed believe in her ability that was frightening. “Even this morning, he was taking the exercise lightly. There I thought I had a pretty good formation going too..” Trailing off, Morgan fiddled with her fingers. What had seemed like a good plan now seemed inadequate in hindsight.</p>
<p>“You want him to believe in you, yet you think he has a better plan that you do.” Yuliya tried again, amazed. The tactician in front of her had displayed the cunning to outwit the academy’s instructors, but was now reduced to obvious ruses that she could easily pick up on. “Why can’t you believe that he may choose not to say those things because he trusts in your ability? Or perhaps, because he trusts you as you are? You’re the tactician of the battlegroup Morgan, regardless of our prior positions. He may be the prodigy of our year’s mages, but that does not make him any more important on the battlefield. Look at where’ve you placed me,” waving at the game in progress between the two of them. Morgan’s archer squads were placed on a hill between both armies, perfectly positioned to flank the ongoing melee. Unfortunately the hill was gently sloping towards Yuliya’s cavalry as well. “Right in the middle of danger. I have half a mind to charge my knights up that hill and kill your archers right now.” Picking up her wooden knight pieces, she thought for a moment before placing them one hexagon closer to Morgan’s archers.</p>
<p>Feigning disinterest, Morgan instead picked up her infantry pieces and marched them toward Yuliya’s. “It’s not a matter of trust Yul. I really enjoyed the few times we spoke to each other. Yet all I’ve gleaned from them is that Telrize is extremely capable, living up to the history of his family. That he wants to be a capable wizard and complete his spell revision theory, which is beyond the scope of an academy magus. Being capable to match the swordsmen in their physical training is another bonus to his capability.”</p>
<p>“So you can speak to the mage. Who knew?”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to be serious here Yuliya!” Morgan groaned. Expressing her feelings was hard enough without her best friend joking to her about it!</p>
<p>Yuliya, however, nodded simply. Beneath Morgan’s apparent storm of emotions all she needed was probably a simple nudge in the right direction. “Where you are, Morgan, is by the edge of the chasm between you and that mage. You’re looking over the edge, trying to see a bottom but only seeing darkness and space. The distance makes you cringe doesn’t it? Partly because it seems so endless and it isolates you from anything to do with him, partly because you’ve seen it before and it brought you nothing but pain.”</p>
<p>“If you look down the chasm, you’ll only see your fall. Instead, look forward and you’ll see that the other side still exists. He may be trying to build a bridge across as well!”</p>
<hr>
<p>“Hey! Michealis! I’ve got that orb you wanted me to look at identified. Could I pass it back to you now?” Telrize waved through the window of the house, trying to catch his attention. That he came exactly around the time where Michealis was expecting company for dinner made him a little too obvious in Michealis’ eye, but he mentally cast that thought aside.</p>
<p>“Thanks. Did the advance I paid you previously cover it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it did. With that money I managed to buy a new focusing crystal for the staff you made me. Don’t know about you, but your sister really knows how to pick out jewels.” Telrize quipped, tapping the staff on his back. Reflecting the evening sunlight the staff glowed, faint runes inscribed faintly resonating with the mage’s aura. The crystal at its tip however, sparkled with an ocher hue, powerfully challenging even the evening rays of the sun in radiance. Michealis smiled in satisfaction as he saw the improved staff. Through Morgan’s efforts, the staff now excluded power that was absent when Michealis first completed it.</p>
<p>“In that case, why not stay for dinner? I believe Morgan would be delighted to have you over.”</p>
<p>Telrize grinned widely. “Is that so? Your sister gave me an interesting position this morning too, with a wide angle of fire yet easy to protect both myself and others. Don’t mind if I speak to her for a moment?”</p>
<p>Michealis blinked. Telrize had declared only a few months ago that he was ‘tired of simple distractions’ and wanted to ‘become a renowned wizard’ before they graduated from their academy. Morgan had returned home with a stormy expression on her face that day, kicking her boots aside before grabbing her elementary spellbook. ‘So Morgan managed to get across to him after all, eh?’ Placing a hand on the mage’s shoulder, he smiled reassuringly. “Sure, come in! I’m sure she’s free to chat!”</p>
