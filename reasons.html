                    <p>“Three thousand gold coins for this slab of metal on a stick?” Michealis roared. “Even a granny would be embarrassed to claim it was her parasol! Your chain of shops are comprised of thieves, blacksmith! Its shopkeepers rob in broad daylight!” He slammed his fist on the countertop. A moment ago he was looking to purchase several bars of steel and Damascus when his eye came upon the other wares in the shop. Now Michealis was considering if he should buy any at all.</p>
<p>“Watch your mouth, child! I won’t have an upstart young kid like you slander my wares!” The portly balding blacksmith stood up with fists clenched. He was shorter than Michealis even after two decades of age, but that did not cow him; instead he glared at the younger blacksmith in indignation. A crowd, formed from passers-by and regulars in the market watched in anticipation. Michealis was already notorious for his perfectionist streak, one that he also demanded from other blacksmiths in the city. That not everyone else had similar skill in forging was lost on him.</p>
<p>“The sword’s blade is unevenly sharped and the hilt is loose!” Michealis continued, shaking the sword by the tip. “Not only would it jar the hands of the swordsman who uses it, it will break after a few clashes on a shield! Even you know this, to miss putting your mark on the blade so how the hell can you sell it for that price?!” The blade itself was not of noteworthy design compared to other wares in the shop, yet it was polished to a sheen that belied its true worth.</p>
<p>Slamming his hands on the table the older blacksmith roared, grabbing Michealis by the cuff and dragging him down to his height. “Your insistence upon quality is lost upon the masses, kid! Not everyone can afford the ‘premium’ quality that you forge, nor can the city’s demands for weapons be sated by your piss slow rate of forging! Half the city already knows of your traipsing around the countryside for ‘rare ores’ that have you coming back with nary a weapon forged! How the hells do you think you’ll arm anyone at all, eh?”</p>
<p>Michealis opened his mouth to retort, raising himself to his proper height, but the older blacksmith dragged him down again, bringing them face to face. “I care not that you demand wares that only the rich can buy, but this is not your city. Hell you’re hardly even here half the time! So beat it, kid, before I beat you.” Raising his fist, the older blacksmith made a show of swinging it. Michealis pushed himself off, sidestepping the blow anyway and smashed his right fist into the older blacksmith’s face. He stumbled back, blood streaming from his nose before another punch laid him on the ground.</p>
<p>“And stay there till you can find it in your brain to put your craftsmanship before profit.” Michealis growled. “I won’t have you cheapen our art and get people killed with such pathetic wares.” With his fury still pouring out in waves, he grabbed his pack and stalked off; heedless of the commotion he drew. His reasons for making a scene were as plain as the poorly constructed weapons scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>“That’s Michealis Hauteclere right? No wonder he’s got the gall to pick fights with any blacksmith in town; he only buys the basic materials and finds the rest himself! In the wilderness!”</p>
<p>“The man’s insane. He’ll lose not just his trade when he leaves town but also his life when he adventures out simply for ore.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that. Have you seen his works? Definitely on the premium end, yet genuinely magical! I can easily see why shoddy workmanship riles him so much, what with travelling the world for ores; he’s bound to encounter monsters in the wild. A poorly constructed weapon simply won’t do.”</p>
<p>“They say he travels out with his party of friends, all professionals in their own right. His sister, in particular, now there’s a gem in the raw! Her sense of tactics and strategies once drove the army’s grand strategist into utter defeat, did you know? What I’d do to get into a-”</p>
<p>“Get into a what, exactly?” Glaring at the chattering onlookers as he stomped past, Michealis huffed as he hiked his pack higher up his back, a glowing red orb shining through its leathers. “Don’t make me throw this orb of fire at you.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Michealis made his way back to a modest house near the outskirts of the city. Amongst the poorer shacks and the shoddily constructed homes his low-built home stood with a workshop attached. Interestingly, the house never saw a mark that signaled attempted intrusion. A handmade sign hung on the front door. “Weapons for Sale! Hauteclere’s Home and Shoppe!” in flowing, yet structured writing. Michealis was in firm belief that any craftsmen needed no fancy signs, eccentric gizmos nor beautiful assistants for advertisement; the quality of his work should reflect the skill that brought in his customers. Yet seeing the hopeful eyes Morgan held as she held up the flowery sign years ago, a weeks’ worth of effort, he was willing to make one exception. Nevermind that the other townspeople sung praises about his sister’s beauty and cunning. That was another issue that deserved little attention. “I’m back!” he yelled to no one in particular as he strode into the house.</p>
<p>From the living room, Morgan sat hunched over a board game, intensely glaring at the board. That she’d failed to deliver her usual reply full of good cheer intrigued Michealis, but with her childhood friend Yuliya sitting opposite her giving a theatrical sigh and waving back at him, Michealis supposed nothing was amiss. He headed for his workshop, keen to forge another weapon to silence his naysayers. Within his workshop his anvil sat in the middle, drawing the first glance of any who entered it. That the surface still reflected the sunlight that poured in from an open window after years of use spoke to its masterful quality. Michealis ran his hand over it. Compared to immaterial things, few physical things in the world meant as much to him as the anvil in his shop, a relic that was handed down generations within the Hauteclere house. Constructed from a legendary metal that could no longer be found, it was the source of his pride and the envy of many a blacksmith. Some had even gone off to claim that the quality of his work stemmed from the anvil itself. It had once been his father’s pride and joy as well, upon which he forged the blade that now hung on the commander of the royal army’s belt. Of course, he had taken no payment for the blade, instead demanding that the royal army kept his anvil, and by extension his family and home safe. Now, the anvil sits in a small workshop of a modest house, which Michealis forges weapons of masterful quality. Many knights, axemen and halberdiers considered it a blessing to wield a ‘Hauteclere’ into battle; they never broke, were perpetually sharp and, if enchanted, held powerful enchantments that never lost their potency.</p>
<p>“Slander their wares indeed! All they’re asking for is a good weapon that puts their cheaply made ones to shame. Let the customer decide if he wishes to get killed when his weapons snaps in the field!” Michealis thought as he ignited his forge and donned his smithing apron. The sun was high in the sky, which meant he had enough time to forge a weapon before needing to prepare dinner. Morgan would undoubtedly be caught up in her game, after all. “A fire-enchanted polearm would be good.. Knight Commander Nephenee had said she needed one over dinner last week.”</p>
<p>When the fire grew hot enough to his liking, Michealis plunged an ingot of Damascus into the flames. Smiling as the bar slowly grew white hot, like the purity of Morgan’s smile as he once teased her, he heard her whine from the living room. “You don’t know what it’s like Yuliya! It’s easy to see the logic yet following it is impossible!” Furrowing in concern, Michealis made a mental note to see if she was alright over dinner. ‘Better focus on the polearm first.’  Instinctively, he withdrew the bar when he deemed it hot enough and began the arduous process of hammering it into shape. Even as a child, he loved the sound of a blacksmith’s hammer striking metal, more than the music that his mother would occasionally play for the family. Each time it sounded, he considered it yet another step towards finishing a masterpiece, one that could live up to his family’s name. Several hours passed before he was satisfied with the polearm’s blade. With an Orichalcum file, he gave the weapon a keen edge. He plunged the blade into the forge once again, flames roaring as it heated the blade.</p>
<p>“Morgan’s having illogical troubles eh?” He smirked. “The whole thing probably started when she heard that boy claim he first wanted to be a renowned wizard. After all, she does hate waiting.”</p>
<p>Michealis took the orb of fire out of his pack, along with a handful of Elunium chunks to bridge the “flow of the orb into a weapon”, as his father called it. Laying the Elunium chunks on the orb, he smiled as the orb absorbed the metal, softening into a paste. It certainly looked like he was playing with molten lava. Pouring the mixture into the polearm’s blade, he began hammering at it. The Damascus blade eagerly absorbed the fiery properties of the mixture as it melded into the metal. Hammering at the enchanted weapon now demanded precision on top of the strength required; uneven distribution of the mixture would result in uneven distribution of the orb of fire, weakening the enchantment overall. The right process was slow and excruciating. Frowning at the thought to hammer faster and let the orb spread naturally, he disciplined his mind. Such corner-cutting was the reason why many other blacksmiths forged inferior arms. Where the weapon demanded attention and dedication, the blacksmith must provide. The weapon would go on to protect its wielder, and Michealis would be damned before he allowed a Hauteclere to fall bereft of quality. His thoughts focused on the recipient of the polearm. Nephenee had her own problems too, as a Knight Commander. The quality and maintenance of her weapon should not demand more attention; she had better things to do! He plunged the polearm’s blade into the forge for the last time. The Knight Commander had adventured with them once, when they were young and foolish. Those were the days they could jokingly swear to be household names: “With a Hauteclere in your arm and mind, Pale Flowers by your back and an Ashera leading the charge, all of heaven would bow down!” Amusingly, most of the adventuring party started becoming well known when they broke up for their individual professions.</p>
<p>Michealis withdrew the blade from the flames and inspected his work briefly. The weapon bore no flaws; no cracks nor notches of any sort. He dipped it into a barrel of oil, sighing as he heard the familiar hissing. Looking upon the weapon once more, a deeply satisfied smile grew on his face. The red-hot metal was now replaced by a marble sheen of Damascus that now reflected a tinge of crimson, flawless and utterly strong. The blade, even without a haft was strong enough to cleave through whatever monster Nephenee would face. The fiery enchantment suffused over the weapon, quiet foreboding aura that would exact its fury when struck. The weapon was complete save for the haft, which he would complete later. Satisfaction washed over him, confident and proud of his work.</p>
<p>‘They all have their own ways to gain this feeling.’</p>
<p>Michealis imagined the same satisfied smile on his friends. On his sister, when a plan fell into place and it was time to tip the scales in their favor. On Yuliya, when her arrow found its target at a distance that would make any other archer cry. On Nephenee, when she crashed through a monster’s defense, exposing their vulnerabilities and on Dussel, when he held the line against anything that dared attack them. Michealis looked out his window to see the sun beginning to set. ‘Sun’s setting, better get dinner ready.’ Grinning in anticipation that everyone would be together for dinner again, he set Nephenee’s unfinished weapon down. Certainly that would be the highlight of his day instead.</p>
