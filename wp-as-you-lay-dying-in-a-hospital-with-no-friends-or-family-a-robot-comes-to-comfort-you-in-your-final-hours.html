                    <p>It was a losing battle from the start. This body, wracked with pain and suffering yet trying its best to live on, was screaming with all it had to survive the infection. The infection too, struggled its best to continue to live within my body. Of course, the doctors had done what they could. Over the past months, I’ve seen the number of visitors dwindle from the whole family of ten to none. The hospital bills grew in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>[Do you need assistance, Mr. Dawkins?]<br>
A robotic voice spoke. Half concerned, half monotone, it was an interesting mix of sound within the robotic nurse that hosptials began employing after humans began to become too expensive.</p>
<p>“No, I am fine.”<br>
[Your mental state turned to sorrow a moment ago. My programmer has programmed me with the knowledge that sorrow can be a source of pain.]<br>
It started rolling over, one human-looking arm carrying a tablet no doubt containing information on me for any other humans to read. The other arm though, seemed as if a spider had its hairs all turned into medical tools then brushed down delicately.</p>
<p>“My body is in constant pain. It is dying.”<br>
[Your body is in pain. Shall I prescribe some painkillers? Alternatively, I could call for a doctor.]<br>
On the spider-looking arm, a needle sprang up.
“That won’t be necessary. Tell me, nursing robot, how many humans have you seen die?”</p>
<p>[Many. Some die alone, some die surrounded by family. But all humans entering this hospital on beds die eventually.]<br>
“Huh…didn’t know nursing robots were allowed to speak so simply about death statistics.”<br>
[We aren’t. However I have determined that your body has begun shutting down. The infection has reached your heart and you will die in minutes. My programmer installed a module to pacify the dying as best possible.]<br>
“Your programmer sounds like a nice person.” I sighed, closing my eyes. The thought of death approaching within minutes felt..lonely.
The robot rolled over to my bedside, placing the tablet on the table beside. Grasping my hand, it squeezed it gently.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”<br>
[Consoling you. Hand-holding seems to be common amongst those saying farewell to loved ones. As well as those in love.]<br>
The robot spoke the last line as if confused.</p>
<p>“Am I your loved one?”<br>
[No. But I have searched over ten thousand databases and have come to the conclusion that humans desire love.]<br>
“That sounds…nice.”<br>
Every breath was getting shallower and exerting more energy to breathe harder just made my lungs feel like they were on fire. Even in the darkness that is my closed eyes, the pain refused to go away.</p>
<p>[Relax Mr. Dawkins. I am here for you, even if no one else is.]<br>
“Did your programmer teach you that as well?”<br>
[No. But he did teach me that no man deserves to die alone.]<br>
“Perhaps he could teach a robot to love too.”<br>
[Unknown. But I will now instead fulfill what he taught me. Mr. Dawkins, I will be here.]<br>
Continuing to gently squeeze my hand, the robot began to play a soft meledy. Light tunes, full of life like the forest in the middle of spring intersecting with occasional beats that seemed to fade ever gently into the abyss.</p>
